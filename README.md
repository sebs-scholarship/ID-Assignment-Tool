# SSF-ID-Assignment-Tool
## About
The SSF ID Assignment Tool was created to assist the SEBS Scholarship Foundation in assigning unique identifiers to scholarship applicants. We do this to ensure that applicants are given a fair and unbiased chance at receiving a scholarship.

## How It Works
This tool was created with security in mind as we respect the privacy of our applicants. Because of this, we knew that our ID tool had to be unbiased, and generated independently of any personally identifying information. The algorithm chooses random names from the list of names provided. Based on the order that names were selected, we assign ID's that are uniformly distributed and unique for inputs with 24,300,000 names or less. Because the names are randomly chosen, this process is not replicable, and therefore cannot be used to determine which IDs were assigned, or to whom.
